Peter Gerald Aitken (born 30 June 1954) is a Welsh former footballer who played nearly 300 games in the Football League.
Aitken began his career as an apprentice with Bristol Rovers, making his debut in the 1972â€“73 season. He joined local rivals Bristol City in 1980, and two years later, with the club in danger of folding, Aitken was one of the "Ashton Gate Eight", eight players who agreed to terminate their contracts to save the club. The others were Dave Rodger, Geoff Merrick, Julian Marshall, Chris Garland, Jimmy Mann, Trevor Tainton, and Gerry Sweeney. While at Rovers he was the club captain, and after joining City he became the only player to captain both Bristol Clubs.
Aitken joined York City, playing 18 times before the end of the season. After a spell in Hong Kong, in July 1982 he joined non-league Bath City, although also played once for Bournemouth on non-contract terms the following season. He remained with Bath until June 1985 when he left to join Trowbridge Town. He later joined Forest Green Rovers before rejoining Bath City in February 1988, although was released at the end of the season. 
He returned to Bath for a third time in the 1991 close season, as assistant manager under Tony Ricketts. However, he was released as part of a cost-cutting process before the end of the season. He was later assistant manager to Lindsay Parsons a Cheltenham Town and briefly appeared for them on one occasion. He later returned to Bristol Rovers to work in their Community Department, taking up the post of Community Manager in 2000, a post he held until October 2016.
