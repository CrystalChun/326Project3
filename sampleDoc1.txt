There are three airports in the Svalbard area, Svalbard Airport, Ny-Ålesund Airport and Svea Airport.

Svalbard Airport, Longyear is the main airport serving the archipelago. Located 3 kilometres (2 mi) northwest of Longyearbyen, it is the northernmost airport in the world with public scheduled flights. The first airport near Longyearbyen was constructed during World War II.[3] It was first put into use for occasional flights in 1959, but could only be operated a few months a year. Construction of the new airport at Hotellneset started in 1973, and the airport was opened on 2 September 1975.[4] It is owned and operated by state-owned Avinor. In 2009, the airport had 138,934 passengers.[5] Scandinavian Airlines System operates daily flights to Tromsø and Oslo on mainland Norway.[6] Lufttransport provides services to Ny-Ålesund Airport and Svea Airport, using Dornier Do 228 turboprop aircraft. There are also regular charter flights.[7] On 29 August 1996, Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 crashed into Operafjellet mountain about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) from the airport. All 141 people on board the Tupolev Tu-154M were killed. It is the worst air crash in Norwegian history.[8]

Arktikugol, the owner of the company town of Barentsburg, operates a Mil Mi-8 helicopter from the heliport at Heerodden, 2 kilometres (1 mi) outside of town, as well as a heliport at their former town of Pyramiden. During the Cold War, Aeroflot retained a large helicopter base at Heerodden, operating five Mi-8 which could quickly be retrofitted with arms, plus regular staff both at Svalbard Airport (for occasional charter flights) and Heerodden. In 2006, one helicopter was lost in the Heerodden helicopter accident.
